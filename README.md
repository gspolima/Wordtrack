# Wordtrack
An API to query, create and edit information about books you've read and those you want to read.

### Endpoints
To see a list of all operations available and their respective routes, parameters and possible responses, you must build and run the API project and then open https://localhost:44330/swagger/index.html on a browser tab (the port might change according to machine-specific configuration).
It's currently running on .NET 5.

### Roadmap
I intend to add authentication for a personalized experience and furthermore an Angular app to consume the API.

### Progress board
Here's a simple board where I keep track of the functionality that has been implemented so far
