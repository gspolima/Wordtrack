# Wordtrack
An API to query, create and edit information about books you've read and those you want to read.

### Endpoints
To see a list of all operations available and their respective routes, parameters and possible responses, you must build and run the API project and then open [this URL](https://localhost:44330/swagger/index.html) on a browser tab (the port might change according to machine-specific configuration).
It's currently running on .NET 5.

### Requests
You can download and import a file with the HTTP requests inside your Postman in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/gspolima/dd6e9ddcd9f9f7c490bdce3900067d03).

### Roadmap
I intend to add authentication for a personalized experience and furthermore an Angular app to consume the API.

### Progress board
There's a [simple board](https://trello.com/b/Wm2h0DQJ) where I keep track of the functionality that has been implemented so far.
